# DeepShield-AI-Powered-Deepfake-Image-Detection-using-ResNet50
DeepShield is an AI-driven deepfake image detection system that leverages the ResNet50 deep convolutional neural network to classify images as Real or Fake. The model is trained on a dataset of manipulated and authentic human faces to learn discriminative visual patterns that differentiate deepfakes from genuine images.
